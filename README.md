# Home Lab Journey

This project documents my buildout of a self-hosted home lab using:

- VirtualBox with Ubuntu Server 24.04
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Portainer for container management
- Custom services like LLMs, media servers, and dashboards

> Powered by curiosity, caffeine, and the ambition to become a cloud architect.
